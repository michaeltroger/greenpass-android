Unofficial app that is fully open source. <b>One PDF can be imported. If you require to import more than that, then please go for one of the other available solutions.</b> This app is basically a super simple PDF reader with convenient fullscreen QR code rendering (if present in the PDF's 1. page).

<b>Brief Instruction</b>
- Open App
- Import PDF
- Done

<b>Alternative Brief Instruction</b>
- Open File browser, Email, Browser, Adobe Reader or a similar app
- Open/Share the PDF with "Green Pass" 
- Done

<b>Description</b>
Very simple app, that does nothing more than conveniently displaying the "Green Pass" certificate, from a given PDF file. The PDF has to be present already on the phone. In Austria the Green Pass is a PDF document with QR code (EU Digital Certificate) that can be downloaded from gesundheit.gv.at Other PDFs should generally work too though, since this app follows a universal approach. 

<b>Functionality</b>
The PDF file has to be imported into the app. Following the QR code is displayed in fullscreen (only if present in the PDF's 1. page), as well as the PDF itself. That's already it.

<b>More Features</b>
- PDFs can be opened and shared from other apps
- Dark Mode support
- Supports also password protected PDFs

<b>Does one require this app?</b>
Not really. For the Green Pass PDF any casual PDF-Reader is completely sufficient. The use case for this app is solely the improved usability. One saves the time for searching the PDF and zooming in for the QR code (if present in the document).

<b>Why offering this app when there is an official one?</b>
This app was created before an official app was available.

<b>Why does the fullscreen QR code look differently than in the PDF?</b>
The algorithm to display is different. For reading devices the code is identical.

<b>Privacy</b>
This app doesn't need any permissions. That also means it has no access to internet etc. The document is solely copied to the app's cache and is merely read out for displaying. The document doesn't ever leave the app, stays locally and offline and can be removed from the cache by the user whenever he/she wishes. No ads, no tracking. The app is fully open source.

<b>Problems with the app?</b>
First of all I want to point out that this is a free time project of a single developer. Since there are thousands of different Android devices and even more different configurations, I ask for your understanding that in extremely rare cases the app could misbehave, e.g. when importing the PDF. If there is any problem then I ask you kindly to contact me and I'll try to help. My email address can be found on this site.
