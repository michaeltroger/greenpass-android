Very simple app, that does nothing more than conveniently displaying the "Green Pass". The PDF has to be present already. The Austrian Green Pass is a one-sided PDF document (EU Digital COVID Certificate) that can be downloaded from https://gesundheit.gv.at The reader was optimized for this use-case (Austrian vaccination and test certificate). Other one-sided PDF documents should generally work too though.

The functionality is as follows: The PDF file that you downloaded from https://gesundheit.gv.at has to be imported into the app. Following its first page will be rendered whenever you open the app. That's already it.
This app assumes you have the PDF certificate from gesundheit.gv.at already on your phone.

Does one require this app? Not really. The PDF from gesundheit.gv.at is completely sufficient. The use case for this app is solely the improved usability. 

Privacy and safety is important! This app doesn't need any permissions. Also no internet connection is required. The document is solely copied to the app's cache and is merely read out for displaying. The document doesn't ever leave the app and can be removed from the cache by the user whenever he/she wishes. No ads, no tracking. The app is fully open source
