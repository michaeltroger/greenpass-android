## Reporting a Vulnerability
You can privately report vulnerabilities on GitHub through the "Security" -> "Report a vulnerability" function (preferred).
If you don't have a GitHub account you can also contact me via [email](https://michaeltroger.com/contact).

If you prefer to share an issue publicly, then please create a ticket in the form of a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/michaeltroger/greenpass-android/issues).

This is a free time project only and therefore responses can take a little while. I ask for your understanding.
